# Papercuts

Small, actionable friction found during agent work. Agents append entries when
they hit a solvable hurdle; they do not stop the current task to fix one.

### [x] Bun status hides linked packages exposed through `file:` dependencies — 2026-08-11
- Friction: a repository consumed through `file:` can expose linked packages
  from its own `node_modules` without identifying the cross-repository source.
- Fix (2026-08-11): Bun status and doctor warn with the dependency, package,
  symlink, external target, and unlink-or-override remediation.
- Surface: `effigy deps status bun` and doctor dependency findings.

### [x] Docs index check required `./`-prefixed links — 2026-08-09
- Friction: `collect_index_markdown_links` only matched `(./x.md)`; plain
  `(x.md)` and backtick mentions looked present but counted as missing.
- Fix (2026-08-11): accept `(path.md)` and `(./path.md)`; missing-entry
  failures hint that backtick-only mentions do not count.
- Surface: `crates/effigy-docs-policy` index check.
