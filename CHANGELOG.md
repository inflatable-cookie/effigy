During v0.x, MINOR bumps may include breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking

- Change process spawn from login shell (`sh -lc`) to non-login shell (`sh -c`)
  across all execution paths. Fixes PATH clobbering on Linux where `/etc/profile`
  unconditionally resets PATH in login shells. Parent process environment is now
  inherited correctly on all platforms.

### Added

- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with format, clippy, and test jobs
  on Linux and macOS
- Release binaries workflow (`.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml`) for
  cross-platform binary distribution via GitHub Releases
- Changelog and automated release preparation (`scripts/prepare-release.sh`)

### Changed

- Rename test fixture catalogs from project-specific names (`farmyard`, `dairy`,
  `cream`) to generic names (`catalog_a`, `catalog_b`, `catalog_c`) across all
  test suites, scripts, and documentation
- Use `frontend` in user-facing help text examples instead of project-specific names

### Fixed

- Resolve 5 pre-existing clippy warnings (needless return, vec init-then-push,
  field reassign with default, manual contains)
