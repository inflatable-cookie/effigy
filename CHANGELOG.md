## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Add changelog library implementing the Northstar Changelog Profile — parse,
  format, validate, analyze, and extract changelogs with `effigy changelog`
  subcommands (`validate`, `format`, `analyze`, `extract`)
- Add `effigy release status` and non-destructive `effigy release prepare --plan`
  with `[release]` manifest config, version-file autodetection (`Cargo.toml`,
  `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `VERSION`), changelog readiness checks,
  version/changelog mutation previews, optional gate execution, and JSON
  payloads
- Add non-interactive `effigy release prepare --yes` to apply supported
  version/changelog updates and write `.release-prepared.json` state without
  committing, tagging, or pushing
- Add `effigy release execute --plan` as a preflight that loads
  `.release-prepared.json`, warns on stale prepared state, and verifies the git
  working tree matches the prepared file set before any commit/tag/push work
- Add non-interactive `effigy release execute --yes` to create the release
  commit and tag, push branch and tag to `origin`, print post-release checks,
  remove `.release-prepared.json` only after full success, and refuse to re-tag
  after a failed push
- Add standalone `effigy release gates` with sequential timed gate execution,
  fail-fast behavior, JSON output, and captured failed-gate output for release
  readiness checks outside the full prepare flow
- Add `effigy release simulate` as a full dry-run that runs release gates,
  previews version/changelog mutations plus commit/tag creation, reports
  fail-fast gate metadata, and guarantees no files or `.release-prepared.json`
  state are written
- Add `--dry-run` as a non-destructive alias for `effigy release prepare --plan`
  and `effigy release execute --plan`, so preview-first release flows can use
  either spelling while still producing the same plan payloads
- Preserve existing layout for release version-file updates in `Cargo.toml`,
  `pyproject.toml`, and `package.json` by mutating only the targeted version
  field instead of reformatting the whole file during `effigy release prepare`
  flows
- Add a self-hosted `[release]` section to this repo’s `effigy.toml` and route
  `qa:release` through `effigy release gates`, with contract tests that keep
  the configured baseline gate set aligned with `scripts/check-release-gates.sh`
- Add real `release.sync-files = ["Cargo.lock"]` support for Cargo-based
  release preparation, including prepare-plan/prepare-apply coverage and a
  Cargo-fixture parity test against `scripts/prepare-release.sh --apply`
- Add built-in `effigy release verify-install` for tag-based install
  validation, with the legacy `scripts/check-release-install-from-tag.sh`
  helper now delegating to the built-in command
- Turn `scripts/check-release-gates.sh` into a compatibility wrapper over
  `effigy release gates` plus optional `effigy release verify-install`, and add
  self-hosting contract checks that keep both legacy wrapper entrypoints aligned
  with the built-in release surfaces
- Add end-to-end migration parity tests showing the legacy release wrappers
  execute the same built-in `release gates` and `release verify-install` paths
  on Effigy-shaped fixtures, closing the remaining section-8 parallel-validation
  proof for shipped release surfaces
- Update the release checklist template and maintainer/operator docs to prefer
  the built-in `effigy release simulate/status/prepare/execute/verify-install`
  flow while keeping legacy release scripts documented as backup channels
- Tighten release protocol/checklist wording so built-in commands are clearly
  the primary operator path, legacy shell wrappers remain explicit backup
  channels until the first successful live built-in release, and workflow
  cutover tasks stay clearly human-gated
- Add end-to-end CLI coverage and maintainer guidance for
  `effigy changelog extract` as the preferred release-note baseline generator
  ahead of any approved workflow migration
- Add cross-project release orchestration coverage for `package.json`,
  `pyproject.toml`, and plain `VERSION` repos, plus agent-adoption examples for
  Node.js, Python, and multi-language release configs
- Add dedicated release orchestration guide `051`, update the command matrix to
  include `release` and `changelog` surfaces, and align `CLAUDE.md` with the
  built-in release workflow reference
- Add text-mode interactive confirmation flows for `effigy release prepare` and
  `effigy release execute`, while keeping `--plan` as preview-only and `--yes`
  as the explicit non-interactive path
- Expand text-mode `effigy release prepare` and `effigy release execute` into
  staged review flows with separate version/state, mutation/working-tree, gate,
  and final approval prompts before any release changes are applied
- Require explicit stale-state acknowledgement for `effigy release execute`:
  text-mode execute now inserts a stale-state approval step, while `--plan` and
  `--yes` require `--allow-stale` to proceed when `.release-prepared.json` is
  older than the default threshold
- Allow text-mode `effigy release prepare` to accept a deliberate custom semver
  override during version review, and carry suggested-versus-selected version
  metadata through prepare output and `.release-prepared.json`
- Add `--version <SEMVER>` override support to `effigy release prepare --plan`
  and `effigy release prepare --yes`, so non-interactive preview/apply flows
  can use the same deliberate version-selection contract as interactive prepare
- Tighten `release prepare --version` validation and surface
  suggested-versus-selected version metadata consistently in `release simulate`
- Add `effigy release simulate --version <SEMVER>` so full dry-run previews can
  exercise the same deliberate selected-version contract as non-interactive
  `release prepare` without writing files or state
- Upgrade `effigy release simulate` and `effigy release prepare --plan` with
  richer per-file mutation details and concise inline diff previews for
  supported write mutations
- Add interactive mutation drill-down to plain `effigy release prepare`, so
  Step 2 review can inspect one planned file mutation in detail before apply
- Add interactive drill-down to plain `effigy release execute`, so stale
  warnings and working-tree items can be inspected in detail before approval or
  before a blocked preflight returns failure
- Replace the fixed linear interactive release review flow with compact prepare
  and execute review menus, so operators can jump directly between review
  sections before apply/execute
- Keep interactive release review menus self-describing with a compact command
  legend plus persistent selected-version or stale-acknowledgement summaries,
  so operators can see the active state without re-reading prompt footers
- Mark reviewed sections directly inside interactive release menus and append
  suggested remediation actions to blocked prepare/execute output, so operators
  can track review progress and see the likely next fix path
- Add `effigy release resume` as a dedicated prepared-state recovery command
  that summarizes `.release-prepared.json`, highlights drift since prepare
  time, and can hand operators directly back into interactive execute review
- Add prepared-state source fingerprints to `.release-prepared.json`, so
  `effigy release resume` and `effigy release execute --plan/--yes` can detect
  branch drift, HEAD movement, and changed prepared-file contents since
  prepare time
- Add direct interactive recovery shortcuts to `effigy release resume` and
  `effigy release execute`: operators can now run `gates`, `reprepare`, or
  `discard` from the review flow, and blocked execute preflight exposes the
  same shortcuts before failing
- Add `@env-spec` integration: declarative `.env.schema` files with annotation
  DSL (`@type`, `@required`, `@sensitive`), value expressions (`exec()`,
  `env()`, `${VAR}` templates), type validation, topological dependency
  resolution, and dual environment injection (plain values via shell wrapping,
  secrets via `Command::env()` to avoid `ps` exposure)
- Add `[env_schema]` configuration section in `effigy.toml` with `enabled`,
  `schema` path override, and `exec_timeout` options
- Add `--env-schema <PATH>` task-runtime override so one-off task invocations
  can select a non-default `.env.schema` file without editing `effigy.toml`
- Allow run-array env directives, task-ref expansions, and configured built-in
  test suite env resolution to consume resolved `.env.schema` values for
  internal Effigy planning/runtime behavior
- Add env-schema string constraint annotations (`@min`, `@max`) and regex
  validation via `@pattern`, with task execution now failing before launch when
  resolved values violate those schema rules
- Redact sensitive env-schema validation values from task/runtime error output
  and back `SecretString` with `zeroize::Zeroizing<String>` for stronger
  in-memory secret handling
- Round out the public env-schema library surface with autodetection helpers,
  explicit `resolve_env` / `validate_env` entry points, and `ResolvedEnv`
  export helpers that return `HashMap<String, EnvValue>`
- Validate `[env_schema]` manifest configuration more strictly and add runtime
  coverage for `enabled`, `schema`, and `exec_timeout` behavior
- Extend env-schema secret redaction coverage across JSON-mode runner failures
  and resolved-env debug output so sensitive values stay masked across normal
  Effigy reporting surfaces
- Add roadmaps for Varlock @env-spec integration (025), changelog library and
  Northstar Profile (026), and release orchestration system (027)

### Changed
- Cut over `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml` to use built-in
  `effigy changelog extract` for GitHub Release notes with the existing
  generated-notes fallback preserved, and refresh the touched GitHub-managed
  action versions used by release/CI/JSON-contract workflows ahead of the
  Node 24 runtime transition

### Fixed
- Align `scripts/check-distribution-metadata.sh` with the actual
  `release-binaries.yml` workflow and current distribution helper scripts, so
  release metadata validation no longer fails on obsolete workflow file names
  during built-in release rehearsals

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Publish `inflatable-cookie/setup-effigy@v1` GitHub Action for CI binary
  installation with caching
- Add ARM Linux (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) binary to release pipeline and
  Homebrew formula (for AWS Graviton, Docker on Apple Silicon)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Homebrew formula now supports Linux (Linuxbrew) via `on_linux` block for
  x86_64 binaries

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Fix release pipeline failure caused by using `secrets` context in job-level
  `if` condition — `secrets` is only available at step level in GitHub Actions

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- Homebrew tap auto-update in release pipeline — formula in
  `inflatable-cookie/homebrew-tap` is updated automatically on each tagged
  release
- JSON contracts CI workflow (`.github/workflows/json-contracts.yml`) now
  active on PRs, pushes to main, and daily schedule
- CHANGELOG-based release notes — GitHub Releases now use entries from
  CHANGELOG.md instead of auto-generated notes
- Install section in README with three channels: Homebrew, prebuilt binary,
  and cargo install from source

### Changed
- Replace ripgrep (`rg`) with POSIX `grep` in all QA and docs-check scripts
  so CI runners work without ripgrep installed
- Remove `.github-bak/` staging directory — all workflows are now active or
  superseded
- Update doc 042 (Homebrew Tap) to reflect prebuilt binary formula approach
- Update doc 049 (Release Protocol) to reflect current active workflow state

### Fixed
- Fix JSON contracts CI failure caused by `rg` not being available on
  ubuntu-latest runners
- Fix stale `.github-bak/` workflow references across documentation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-09

### Breaking
- Change process spawn from login shell (`sh -lc`) to non-login shell (`sh -c`)
  across all execution paths. Fixes PATH clobbering on Linux where `/etc/profile`
  unconditionally resets PATH in login shells. Parent process environment is now
  inherited correctly on all platforms.

### Added
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with format, clippy, and test jobs
  on Linux and macOS
- Release binaries workflow (`.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml`) for
  cross-platform binary distribution via GitHub Releases
- Changelog and automated release preparation (`scripts/prepare-release.sh`)

### Changed
- Rename test fixture catalogs from project-specific names (`farmyard`, `dairy`,
  `cream`) to generic names (`catalog_a`, `catalog_b`, `catalog_c`) across all
  test suites, scripts, and documentation
- Use `frontend` in user-facing help text examples instead of project-specific names

### Fixed
- Resolve 5 pre-existing clippy warnings (needless return, vec init-then-push,
  field reassign with default, manual contains)
