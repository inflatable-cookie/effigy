# Backlog Roadmaps

Backlog roadmaps are intentionally unnumbered and exploratory.  
Use this folder for planning threads that are important but not yet scheduled into numbered execution phases.

## Current Backlog Items

- [Distribution Channels](./distribution-channels.md)
- [Release Contract (v0.x)](./release-contract-v0.md)

## Promotion Rule

When a backlog item gets an agreed execution window and owner commitment, promote it into a numbered roadmap in `docs/roadmap/` and track progress there.
