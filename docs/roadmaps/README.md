# Roadmaps

Roadmaps are executable milestone plans derived from Effigy vision and architecture.

## Generation model

- Use generation folders: `g01`, `g02`, `g03`.
- Use milestone files inside each generation: `NNN-<slug>.md`.
- Reference milestones as `gNN.NNN`.
- Trigger generation rollover manually; do not use automatic file-count limits.

## Layout

- `g01/` current roadmap generation
- `generation-index.md` active generation and rollover history
- `backlog/` deferred scope with promotion criteria

## Current queue

- `g01/001` through `g01/012` capture the delivered Effigy implementation baseline.
- `g01/013-effigy-northstar-doctrine-alignment.md` records this Northstar migration and is complete.
- The next active Effigy milestone should start at `g01.014`.

## Backlog

Deferred roadmap items live in [backlog/README.md](./backlog/README.md).

## Batch and logging rule

- Execute milestones in meaningful batches.
- Create logs per completed batch or update cycle, not per individual task.

## Next Task

Open the next Effigy milestone in `g01/` when a net-new roadmap batch is ready.
