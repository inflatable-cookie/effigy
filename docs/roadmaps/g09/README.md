# g09 Roadmaps

Status: Active
Theme: Operator command-surface clarity

## Purpose

`g09` tests command-surface compaction in live use, then keeps only the part that
helps: grouped discovery with direct execution.

## Roadmaps

- [`001-command-surface-compaction-preview.md`](./001-command-surface-compaction-preview.md)
- [`002-flat-command-execution.md`](./002-flat-command-execution.md)

## Design Posture

- one command implementation and one output owner per operation
- help groups organize discovery; direct built-ins are canonical execution
- task selectors and slash catalog selectors stay deterministic
- no silent break, removal, release, or consumer rewrite
- structured machine warnings never contaminate JSON stdout

## Current State

[`g09.001`](./001-command-surface-compaction-preview.md) and
[`g09.002`](./002-flat-command-execution.md) are complete historical evidence.
Direct invocation is canonical; help grouping remains.

## Next Task

Run the 2026-09-17 vision governance review. Effigy release authority stays
separate.
