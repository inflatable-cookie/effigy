# Effigy Docs

Effigy documentation is organized into three top-level categories:

- `architecture/`: stable design and package/runtime boundaries.
- `roadmap/`: numbered phase plans and progress tracking.
- `reports/`: dated execution reports, checkpoints, and sweeps.

Use architecture docs as the source of truth, roadmap docs for execution planning, and reports for evidence/history.
