# Effigy Docs

Effigy documentation is organized into four top-level categories:

- `architecture/`: stable design and package/runtime boundaries.
- `guides/`: operational runbooks and implementation guides.
- `roadmap/`: numbered phase plans and progress tracking.
- `roadmap/backlog/`: unnumbered exploratory plans not yet scheduled.
- `reports/`: dated execution reports, checkpoints, and sweeps.

Use architecture docs as the source of truth, roadmap docs for execution planning, and reports for evidence/history.

Notable guide additions:
- `guides/013-testing-orchestration.md`
- `guides/014-release-checklist-template.md`
